    "### 1. Initializing RFE\n",
    "`\n",

    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "- RFE = Recursive Feature Elimination.\n",
    "- model = Logistic Regression.\n",
    "- n_features_to_select=5 → we want to keep only 5 features at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 What happens behind the scenes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- RFE trains the model on all features.\n",
    "- The model provides a feature importance ranking (coefficients in Logistic Regression, or weights in SVM, or feature_importances_ in Tree-based models).\n",
    "- RFE removes the least important feature.\n",
    "- Then it retrains with the reduced set, removes the least important again…\n",
    "- Repeats this until only 5 features remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it’s like an iterative elimination tournament.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Fitting on Training Data\n",
    "`\n",
    "rfe.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "Runs the RFE process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train model on all features.\n",
    "- Drop the least important one.\n",
    "- Retrain.\n",
    "- Repeat until 5 features are left.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 After this, rfe remembers which 5 features survived.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Getting the Selected Features\n",

    "print(\"RFE Features:\", rfe.get_support(indices=True))\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "get_support(indices=True) → returns the column indices of the chosen 5 features.\n",

    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "rfe.transform(X_train) → reduces training data to only those 5 selected features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then Logistic Regression is trained on this reduced dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Now the model is simpler, using fewer features.\n",
